# Pong
A simple Implementation of classic game Pong using Pygame.
The Goal is to create a lightweight version of the game, without any unnecessary features, as I want to at some point train an RL agent to play the game.

TO DO
Implement multiplayer mode
Host the game
Implement the game in Zig using Raylib
