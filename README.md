# Pong

A simple implementation of the classic game Pong using Pygame. The goal is to create a lightweight version of the game, without any unnecessary features, as I want to at some point train an RL agent to play the game.

## TO DO
- [ ] Implement logger wandb, increase batch size
- [ ] Implement multiplayer mode
- [ ] Host the game
- [ ] Implement the game in Zig using Raylib
